# LabToolbox Wiki

Welcome to the **LabToolbox Wiki**, the official documentation hub for the LabToolbox Python package.  

This library is designed to streamline data analysis and visualization tasks, with a particular focus on **experimental physics** and related scientific fields. It offers a comprehensive suite of functions for **curve fitting**, **uncertainty propagation**, **signal processing**, **statistical analysis**, and **scientific plotting**, making it an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and professionals alike.

## Overview

LabToolbox is built to simplify complex data analysis workflows by offering robust and user-friendly functions that integrate seamlessly with widely used scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

The package emphasizes **precision**, **clarity**, and **flexibility**, and includes tools for:

- **Curve Fitting**  
  Perform linear regression (WLS and OLS), model-based fitting with error propagation, confidence bands, bootstrap resampling, and residual diagnostics.

- **Data Formatting and Visualization**  
  Generate LaTeX-compatible tables, format measurement results with correct significant digits and units, and create publication-ready plots.

- **Signal Processing**  
  Analyze signals with tools for computing power spectrum, discrete and continuous Fourier series, harmonic content detection, and signal decomposition.

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  Generate histograms, assess skewness and kurtosis, test normality, visualize and analyze residuals, remove outliers, and perform likelihood/posterior estimation.

- **Uncertainty Propagation**  
  Quantify uncertainties using the [uncertainty_class](https://github.com/yiorgoskost/Uncertainty-Propagation/tree/master) package.
